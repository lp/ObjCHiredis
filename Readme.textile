h3. Objective-C Wrapper around "Hiredis":http://github.com/antirez/hiredis

p. Same, Same, Same... but different! Comes in many flavour:
* "A universal _Framework_ for MacOS 10.5 and later, compatible with _MacRuby_ and _Nu_.":https://github.com/genadyo/ObjCHiredis/raw/master/ObjCHiredis/RELEASES/ObjCHiredis_OSX_1o4o0.zip
* "A _Static Library_ for the iOS (armv7 and armv7s).":https://github.com/genadyo/ObjCHiredis/raw/master/ObjCHiredis/RELEASES/ObjCHiredis_iOS_1o4o0.zip
* "A _Static Library_ for the iPhone/iPad Simulator":https://github.com/genadyo/ObjCHiredis/raw/master/ObjCHiredis/RELEASES/ObjCHiredis_Simulator_1o4o0.zip

p. Creation of an autoreleased object is easy and comes in 3 flavours:

bc. ObjCHiredis * redis = [ObjCHiredis redis];
ObjCHiredis * redis = [ObjCHiredis redis:@"127.0.0.1" on:[NSNumber numberWithInt:6379]];
ObjCHiredis * redis = [ObjCHiredis redis:@"127.0.0.1" on:[NSNumber numberWithInt:6379] db:[NSNumber numberWithInt:69]];

p. For now, it behaves in similar manners to Hiredis, in blocking mode, only with an Objective-C Interface:

bc. id retVal = [redis command:@"SET MYKEY MYVALUE"];

p. Or with commandArgv:

bc. id retVal = [redis commandArgv:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                    @"SET", @"MYKEY", @"MYVALUE", nil]];
                    
p. Pub/Sub implementation

bc. [redis command:@"SUBSCRIBE CHANNELZ"];
retVal = [redis getReply];
// Will block until it receives data from a a PUBLISH CHANNELZ.

p. Also inside MacRuby:

bc. framework "ObjCHiredis"
require ObjCHiredis.rb
redis = ObjCHiredis.redisRb
retval = redis.set :mykey, "myvalue"

p. With Nu:

bc. (load "ObjCHiredis")
(load (ObjCHiredis nu))
(set redis (redisNu))
(set retVal (redis "SET" "MYKEY" "MYVALUE"))
